# Goran's Kortjie First Project
This is my first attempt at building a website. it is an attempt to replicate the webpage from the Zeplin application.
# Getting Started
From your Gitbash you can clone this address https://github.com/iFieryGod/Main.git
and use vs code to see it in live server.
# Prerequisites
1 github
2 gitbash
3 vs code
4 internet access
# Installing
install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/

withing VS code install the extension live server.
install Gitbash from https://gitforwindows.org/
install github from https://github.com/ or signup online.
# Running the tests
Tests were run using Live Server which can be accessed through VS code.
# Break down into end to end tests
end to end test were done through Live Server, mostly using the console. Withing the console you can adjust the screen size of the current webpage to test if it responds to small, medium, large or extra large screens. This tests whether the content adjust to different screen sizes and whether it fits properly and according to how you want it to look
# And coding style tests
Style tests were done through live server to test responsiveness. Most responsiveness tests were done through the console on chrome web browser. these tests were conducted to see if styles adjusted according to different screen sizes. this was primarily used to check if certain colors matched.
# Deployment
Within VS code once you have added the extension live server. on the bottom right corner you will be able to click the live server icon and the web page will open in a browser as if it is a live website. Any changes made during your development can be immediately be seen once saved.
